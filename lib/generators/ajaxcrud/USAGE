Description:
    Creates a controller and associated Belphanior view for manipulating a
    simple Model.

    Most models in Belphanior map more-or-less directly onto the associated
    UI list, but the mapping is not quite simple. This generator builds the
    controller and view for manipulating the underlying model, taking care
    of client-server data passage and dynamic updating on the client side.

Example:
    rails generate ajaxcrud model_name [controller_name]

    If controller_name is omitted, pluralized model_name will be used.

    This will create:
        app/controllers/controller_name_controller.rb
        app/helpers/controller_name_helper.rb
        app/views/controller_name/index.html.haml
        test/functional/controller_name_controller_test
