== Belphanior Butler

Belphanior Butler is a command and control program for a Belphanior home automation network.

Features:
* Remembers location of servants.
* Documentation for roles supported by servants.
* Creation of scripts in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and [Blockly](http://code.google.com/p/blockly/)
  scripting environments.
* Definition of simple command buttons for quick access to scripts.
* Support for the ["commandable" servant role](http://belphanior.net/roles/commandable/v1),

  [the calendar watcher](http://github.com/fixermark/belphanior-calendar-watcher-servant)
  may trigger scripts in the butler.
